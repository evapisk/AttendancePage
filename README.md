# AttendancePage
An attendance taker was created for NBPS Middle School to streamline attendance for a large class (200+ students).

The issue: Multiple teachers had to scroll through one large attendance sheet containing students which werent in their class to take attendance. This took up alot of class time.

Solution: an attendance tracker with multiple sheets filtered by how classes were filtered in real life. Categories included gender, sport, and year.

Built in Python and HTML, using SQLAlchemy as a database, Flask for authentication and back-end web development, and Bootstrap for stylization.
